                Tlece is a video-based social media for future career. This is where you as organization can get to know
                your candidates so you can match with each other.
                Register first to Tlece as regular user, and then you can register your organization as described below.
              </p>
              <p>

              <h2>1 Register an organization</h2>
              Any Tlece user can register his/her organization to Tlece, in order to use recruitment features of Tlece.
              Registration is easy and only brand name and organization ID needs to be filled out initially. However,
              before being able to post a job vacancy and process application, the organization needs to provide more
              data, as explained below.

              As a Tlece user, register the organization by the steps described below.

              <br>On the web app:
              <ul>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://app.tlece.com" target="_blank">https://app.tlece.com</a></li>
                <li>Click on your name on the upper left corner, click on “My Account”, then click on “Register
                  Organization”. Fill out at least “Brand name” and “Organization account ID”, and check on “I legally
                  represent this organization to register to Tlece and I agree to the terms and conditions”.
                  “Organization account ID” is lowercase only and must not contain spaces. Later, the following items
                  will be mandatory for verification by Tlece: Legal name, Phone number, Address, Email, Administrator's
                  ID photo/scan, Organization establishment document
